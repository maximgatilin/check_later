# Todo items

## Features
* Make possible to remove items(after redux implementation)
* Show number of items inside tabs(after redux implementation)(v2)
* Ask user which style is preferred for images, this way we actually tell about image generation feature(v2)
* Use css variables, so it's easier to switch dark mode(v2)

## UI/UX
* Try to speed up API, maybe via changing some parameters(v2)

## Code quality
* Go through redux toolkit documentation and think what can be done better(v2)
  * Use middlewares to sync redux vs local storage
  * Use middleware to dispatch image generation when new item is added

## Bugs
* When added both items loading is messy(check after redux implementation)(v2)

## Deployment
* Deploy using github actions
* Store api keys in github env variables
