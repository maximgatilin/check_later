# Todo items

## Features
* Dark theme support(use from system)
* Make possible to remove items(after redux implementation)
* Show number of items inside tabs(after redux implementation)
* Ask user which style is preferred for images, this way we actually tell about image generation feature
* Use css variables, so it's easier to switch dark mode

## UI/UX
* Try to make api faster

## Code quality
* Use redux(with toolkit probably) instead of context
* Handle errors correclty

## Bugs
* When added both items loading is messy(check after redux implementation)

## Deployment
* Deploy using github actions
* Store api keys in github env variables
